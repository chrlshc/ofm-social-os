# DM Rotation Playbook - Safe Sending

## Rate Limits (Critical)
- **Max 1-2 DMs/minute** - Instagram monitors burst patterns
- **Daily limit ~50-100** new DM requests to non-followers 
- **Pause 15-30 min** after every 10-15 messages
- **Never send identical** messages consecutively

## Personalization Strategy
- Use `{model_name}` when visible in bio/username
- Use `{city}` from bio location if available  
- Use `{niche}` for content type (fitness/fashion/lifestyle)
- **Example**: "hey gorgeous just found youre page in miami" vs generic

## Timing & Pattern
- **Spread across hours** - avoid 9-11am spam detection windows
- **Vary message selection** - rotate through lines.json randomly
- **2-3 day gaps** between messages to same user type/niche
- **Monitor response rates** - if <5% replies, pause campaign

## Follow-up Protocol  
- **Wait 48-72h** for initial response
- **One soft follow-up max**: "hey did you see my message about earning more?"
- **No response = blacklist** - never message again
- **Accepted request = switch** to longer conversational messages

## Red Flags to Avoid
- Identical messages in sequence
- Mass sending during peak hours
- Multiple messages to same user
- Using banned terms (rates/prices/sexual/onlyfans)
- Sending media/links in first message

**Key**: Quality over quantity. Better 20 personalized messages than 100 generic spam.
